* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_Main.m
    The main code EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_Main.m requires an input 
    structure with (at least) the vectors of redshifts at which the Hubble
    parameter, H, and the angular diameter distance, d_A, are to be 
    evaluated to be specified. The vectors of redshifts for H, d_A are 
    given as row vectors. If no input is given, these are set in an example 
    default structure, EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_Input.m. The other 
    inputs in the structure are the survey type (photometric versus 
    spectroscopic, the redshift types (ie the redshifts are the edges of 
    bins or the central points in a bin) the increment in redshift and the 
    Input structure. 


* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_setsurvey.m
    If not set by hand in the inputs to EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_Main.m, the 
    type of survey under consideration (specified by the area, number 
    density in the bins and bias etc) are set in setsurvey.m. This example 
    code gives the types of entries expected by the error module.

* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_cummean.m
    This computes the mean (central) redshift of the bins in the case of 
    the edge configuration 
 
* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_calculate_error.m
    This file computes the volume of the bins in H, d_A and calculates 
    the error on H, d_A by calling the fitting formulae of Blake et al.
    2005. 
    It uses:

* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_com_volume.m 
    This computes the volume between two redshift points.
          
* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_fitting_formula.m
    This code computes the error on the oscillation scale in either the 
    parallel or perpendicular directions.The coefficients in the fitting 
    formulae are given by:

* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_photo_params.m 
    This structure encodes the coefficients in the fitting formulae of 
    Blake et al. (2006) for a photometric survey.

* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_spectro_params.m
    This structure encodes the coefficients in the fitting formulae of 
    Blake et al. (2005) for a spectroscopic survey.

* EXT_FF_Blake_etal2005_Example_Surveys.m
    This code computes the errors on H, d_A for various tests and future 
    experiments. They are computed for various survey specifications and 
    input vectors.

If the results produced from the use of this extension of Fisher4Cast 
have been used in a publication, we kindly request that its use and the 
authors of Fisher4Cast and this extension are acknowledged, 
as well as the original authors of arXiv:astro-ph/0701079.

This EXT_FF_SeoEisenstein2007 contains the following files, (which must be 
copied from the original folder and placed in the same directory
as the Fisher4Cast main code, as they access files in the main Fisher4Cast
suite):

* EXT_FF_SeoEisenstein2007_Main.m
    This is a wrapper for all the codes which takes in the input structure 
    with the following survey parameters: 
    z,om,h,ode,ob,wmap,volume,sigma8,Sigma_z,number_density,zdistortion. 
    These include the redshifts, the cosmic parameters of matter density, 
    hubble constant, dark energy density and baryon density, as well as a 
    term wmap which indicates which wmap data set to use in the code. The 
    volume, sigma8 value, galaxy number density and redshift distortions 
    are also required. Should no input structure be defined, default 
    values are taken from the structure EXT_FF_SeoEisenstein2007_Input.m

    The code then produces the required errors on the angular diameter 
    distance Drms (where rms is the root mean square), and the Hubble 
    parameter,Hrms. The output r, gives the correlation coefficient between 
    the measurements of H and D, and Rrms gives root mean square error on 
    D/s and H*s, if one assumes that the oscillation scale in the radial 
    and tangential directions is the same. 

This is done by calling:

* EXT_FF_SeoEisenstein2007_errFit_2007.m
    This code is a Matlab version of the code in C given by Seo & Eisenstein,
    and includes comments from the original code. It uses the next two codes, 
    namely


* EXT_FF_SeoEisenstein2007_LagrangianDisplacement.m
    The Lagrangian Displacement using a normalisation of the Growth function
    (see the Fisher4Cast suite for an analytical function of the Growth 
    function) today and asymptotic behaviour at large redshifts.

* EXT_FF_SeoEisenstein2007_sound_horizon.m
    This code computes the sound horizon based on the formulae in Wang 
    (2006).
