### WHAT IS LIBRA?

LIBRA: a MATLAB Library for Robust Analysis is developed at [ROBUST@Leuven](https://wis.kuleuven.be/stat/robust), the research group on robust statistics at the KU Leuven. It contains user-friendly implementations of several robust procedures. These methods are resistant to outliers in the data. Currently, the library contains functions for univariate location, scale and skewness, multivariate location and covariance estimation (MCD), regression (LTS, MCD-regression), Principal Component Analysis (RAPCA, ROBPCA), Principal Component Regression (RPCR), Partial Least Squares Regression (RSIMPLS), classification (RDA, RSIMCA), clustering, outlier detection for skewed data (including the bagplot based on halfspace depth), censored depth quantiles and detecting cellwise outliers (DDC). For comparison also several non-robust functions are included. Many graphical tools are provided for model checking and outlier detection.

Most of the functions require the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox.

Contributions to this library have been made by (in alphabetical order): Guy Brys, Michiel Debruyne, Sanne Engelen, Mia Hubert, Wai Yan Kong, Nele Smets, Wannes Van den Bossche, Karlien Vanden Branden, Stephan Van der Veeken, Ellen Vandervieren, Katrien Van Driessen, Sabine Verboven, Tim Verdonck en Fabienne Verwerft.

The library can be freely used for non-commercial use only. Please make appropriate references to the corresponding paper(s) if you use any of our programs. The correct references can be found in the help-files, or at the webpage:
