These are Elastix parameter files from the Osten lab. 

These two files are from the Osten lab
01_ARA_affine.txt  
02_ARA_bspline.txt


The file 02_ARA_bspline_10voxel.txt is a modfied version with the b-spline grid-spacing at 10 voxels (the original was 25 voxels). 
The finer spacing works better with some brains that have distortions to due to the injection. Going finer than this risks over-fitting.
