# THIS IS A YML file
# Lines starting with "#" are comment lines



# Provide the name of the animal with only alphanumeric characters [REQUIRED]
# ==> You MUST leave a space after the ":" symbol for the asignment to work <===
animal: XYZ123

# A string defining what sort of data is this? e.g. "traced cells", "nuclear labeling", etc [REQUIRED]
sparseDataType: traced cells

# If there are no traced cells, no further information need be supplied. The file can stop here.


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# All fields that follow are OPTIONAL


# Notes - notes that you might want imported into MATLAB you can  write as follows
# Don't use characters such as: :  , ; '
notes: This was a cell I traced and I enjoyed doing it very much


# Now list the properties of each traced cell on order. 
# e.g. cell 01 corresponds to data in the first cell of the neurite_trees cell array



# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
# Only include the [cell 01] field if there is a traced cell here
cell 01:
  #Exclude from analysis [0 or 1] [0 by default]
  # ==> You MUST indent these lines with two spaces for them to be nested under the cell ID <===
  excludeFromAnalysis: 0
  notes: cell is good

  #Set to 1 if the cell's local axonal tree could not be completely traced [0 or 1] [0 by default]
  localIncomplete: 0

  #Whether the tree needed to be flipped along the dorso-ventral axis [0 or 1] [0 by default]
  flipDV: 0

cell 02:
#If there is nothing here we assume that cell 2 is present and that it should be included in the analysis and that it's completely traced locally



# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#Note we don't have to have a cell 03 and we skip straight to 04
cell 04:
  #This cell is locally not completely traced but should be included in the analysis

  notes: cell is in a terrible state
