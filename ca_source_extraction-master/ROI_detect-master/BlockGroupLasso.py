Some comments:
The main function is
x=gaussian_group_lasso(data,...)
in which we operate on the data array and extract x,
which has the same dimensions like data, but is non-zero only
where neurons are detected. We assume that any "background" has been
subtracted already (e.g., rank-1 non negative matrix factorization components).

Later, by doing
y=std(x,0)
peaks=detect_peaks(y)
we output the neuronal centers from x.
This last bit is somewhat heuristically done using a regional max operation.
This can tend to over-split neurons. This seems better than using
connected components, which over-unify neurons (since these neural centers are
given as initialization to the non-negative matrix factorization script,
we don't want to be too conservative)

There are two main parameters:

1. sig - estimate radius of the neurons (e.g., 5 pixels)
2. lam - regularization parameter which controls the spatial sparsity.
Starting from some initial guess, lam can be automatically adjusted
by setting TargetRange to some range of expected spatial sparsity
(e.g., [0.05, 0.1] ). When I used this on a large dataset (e.g. whole brain)
I segement the dataset to patches and, adjust lam on a about 4
"representative" patches to get a single value which
gives reasonable performance in all patches. I then used this value of lam
on the whole brain (just set TargetRange=[] to avoind lam being adjusted).

One last comment: the algorithm works less well close to the edges
of the image ("close"~sig). I usually just throw away anything detected
near the edges and used overlapping patchs to compnesate.
