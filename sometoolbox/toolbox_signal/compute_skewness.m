%   of its standard deviation.  For a matrix input, S is a row vector

%   SKEWNESS operates along the first non-singleton dimension.

function m = nanmean(x,dim)
%NANMEAN Mean value, ignoring NaNs.
%   M = NANMEAN(X) returns the sample mean of X, treating NaNs as missing
%   values.  For vector input, M is the mean value of the non-NaN elements
%   in X.  For matrix input, M is a row vector containing the mean value of
%   non-NaN elements in each column.  For N-D arrays, NANMEAN operates
%   along the first non-singleton dimension.
%
%   NANMEAN(X,DIM) takes the mean along the dimension DIM of X.
