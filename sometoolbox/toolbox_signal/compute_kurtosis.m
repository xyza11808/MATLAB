function k = compute_kurtosis(x, center_mean)
%compute_kurtosis - compute the Kurtosis. 
%
%   returns the sample kurtosis of the values in X.  For a
%   vector input, K is the fourth central moment of X, divided by fourth
%   power of its standard deviation.  For a matrix input, K is a row vector
%   containing the sample kurtosis of each column of X.  For N-D arrays,
%   KURTOSIS operates along the first non-singleton dimension.

%   K = compute_kurtosis(X, center_mean);

%   computing the kurtosis.

function m = nanmean(x,dim)
%NANMEAN Mean value, ignoring NaNs.
%   M = NANMEAN(X) returns the sample mean of X, treating NaNs as missing
%   values.  For vector input, M is the mean value of the non-NaN elements
%   in X.  For matrix input, M is a row vector containing the mean value of
%   non-NaN elements in each column.  For N-D arrays, NANMEAN operates
%   along the first non-singleton dimension.
%
%   NANMEAN(X,DIM) takes the mean along the dimension DIM of X.
