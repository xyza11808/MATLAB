function T = compute_ball_tf(N,n,sigma,c,p)

% compute_ball_tf - compute the voting kernel of a ball tensor.
%
%   T = compute_ball_tf(N,n,sigma,c,p);
%
%   'N' is the total size of the image (supposed to lie in [0,1]x[0,1]).
%
%       The equation for the decay of the field is
%           DF(s,k) = exp(-(s^2+c*k^2)/sigma^2)
%       where 's' is the length of the circle that joins
%       the two points, and 'k' is its curvature.
%
%   Optional:
%   'sigma' control the scale of the voting field.
%   'c' control the ratio between distance and curvature.
%       The higher 'c' is, the narrower the field will be.
%   'n' is the size of the kernel (should be odd).
%
%   'p' is the number of orientation samples needed to compute the field.
%       (the higher the slower the computation).
%
%   See also compute_stick_tf.
