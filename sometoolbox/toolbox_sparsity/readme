Toolbox sparsity - sparsity-based signal processing related functions.

This toolbox contains functions related to sparsity optimization in signal processing, including 
* general purpose sparse solvers, including OMP, BP and iterative thresholding.
* bilinear optimizers for dictionary design (KSVD and MOD).
* compressed sensing functions.
* theoritical bounds to ensure recovery with L1 optimization (coherence, ERC).
* Morphological Component Analysis algorithm for image separation and inpainting.
* Various helpers functions.
