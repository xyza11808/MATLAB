function y = perform_wavelet_transform_hyperbolic(x,J,options)

% fwt_hyperbolic - multidimensional hyperbolic (i.e. fully tensorial) wavelet transform
% 
%   y = fwt_hyperbolic(x,J,options);
%
%   perform a hyperbolic transform of the array x, on J scale.
%
%   'options' is an (optional) structure that can contain:
%       - 'verb' : control verbosity.
%       - 'type' : the type of 1D wavelet transform used (a string), e.g.
%           'peform_79_transform'.
