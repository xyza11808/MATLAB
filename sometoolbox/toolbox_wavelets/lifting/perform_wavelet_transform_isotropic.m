function y = perform_wavelet_transform_isotropic(x,J,options)

% perform_wavelet_transform_isotropic - multidimensional isotropic wavelet transform (aka classical ND transform).
% 
%   y = perform_wavelet_transform_isotropic(x,J,options);
%
%   Perform a isotropic transform of the array x, on J scale.
%   'x' can be of any dimension. Recalls that the results 
%   are computed 'in place', not using Mallat's ordering.
%   Please see 'fwt_lifting' for an overview of what 
%   'in place' means in 1D.
%
%   'options' is an (optional) structure that can contain:
%       - 'verb' : control verbosity.
%       - 'type' : the type of 1D wavelet transform used (a string), e.g.
%           'perform_79_transform'.
