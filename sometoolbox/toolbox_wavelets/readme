toolbox_wavelets - wavelets related functions.

See html/ help file for exemples of use of this toolbox.

Orthogonal wavelet transform:
- perform_wavelet_transform - implementation of the wavelet transform (orthogonal and translation invariant).
Wavelet transform using lifting implementation (symmetric boundary condition):
- perform_lifting_transform - 5/3 and 7/9 wavelets with lifting (orthogonal and TI).
Pyramid transform:
- perform_pyramid_transform - Laplacian-like pyramidal transform.
- perform_pyramid_transform_do - Minh Do Pyramidal transform (much better).
- perform_pyramid_transform_simoncelli - Steerable pyramid implementation of the Laplacian.
- perform_pyramid_transform_ti - translation-invariance pyramid (difference of Gaussian filterings).
Other transforms:
- perform_haar_transform - a simple but very fast 1D haar transform.
- perform_cpx_dualtree_transform - complex dual tree transform.
- perform_steerable_transform - Steerable pyramid transform.
Compression and coding function:
- perform_jp2k_degradation - Perform JPEG2000 coding and decoding of wavelet coefficients.
- perform_jbig_coding.m - Perform JBig binary image coding (not related to wavelet).
- perform_spiht_coding - Perform SPIHT coding (slow) of the wavelet coefficients.
- perform_wavelet_arithmetic_coding - Perform simple arithmetic coding of the wavelet coefficients.
- perform_shannon_estimation_wavelets - compute the entropy of a wavelet transform.
Helpers functions:
- compute_quadrant_selection - compute the indices for selecting coefficients at a given scale and orientation.
- reorder_coefs - switch from inplace (results of lifting transform) to classical ordering.
- plot_wavelet - plot wavelet using Mallat's ordering.
- convert_wavelets2list - extract each sub-image.

Installation note: you need to add the content of toolbox/ in your Matlab path.
